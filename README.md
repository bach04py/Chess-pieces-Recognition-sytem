## **Features**
- **State-of-the-art models:** Utilizes pre-trained models like **MobileNetV2**, **EfficientNet-B7**, and others for feature extraction and classification.  
- **Customizable architecture:** Models can be fine-tuned for specific datasets.  
- **High accuracy:** Inspired and improved based on findings from published research papers.  
- **Ease of use:** Supports easy integration for inference and evaluation.

## **Requirements**
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:  
- Python >= 3.8  
- PyTorch >= 1.11  
- torchvision >= 0.12  
- Other dependencies (install via `requirements.txt`):  
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## **Datasets**
- **Dataset format:** Chessboard images annotated with labels and bounding boxes for each chess piece.  
- **Source:** Custom dataset or publicly available chess datasets.  

You can preprocess and organize your dataset using the following structure:  
```plaintext
data/
  train/
    Bishop/
    King/
    ...
  val/
    Bishop/
    King/
    ...
```
